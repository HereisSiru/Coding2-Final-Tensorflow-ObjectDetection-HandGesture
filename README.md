# Coding2-Coding2-Tensorflow-ObjectDetection-HandGesture

After study term 2 in CCI i found that i have high curiosity and passion in Tensorflow. 

I divide the project process into two partsï¼š

PART 2: Training and Object Detection





Note: with huge greatful to those person who develops valuable open source code, and also i learned a lot from Nicholas Renotte(https://www.facebook.com/nickrenotte/).
